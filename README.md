# HeartDiseasePrediction

**Description:**  
This project explores early detection of heart disease using age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. The goal is to predict heart disease severity for early intervention using statistical analysis and machine learning models.

**Research Question:**  
Can early detection using factors like cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and age help predict heart disease risk before the disease progresses to severe stages?

**Approach:**  
1. **Data Cleaning & Summary** – Examine dataset for missing or erroneous values.  
2. **Visualization** – Explore relationships between key factors and heart disease severity.  
3. **Statistical Analysis** – Perform ANOVA and logistic regression to identify significant predictors.  
4. **Predictive Modeling** – Build machine learning models (SVM, Decision Tree, Clustering) for early detection.  

**Key Findings:**  
- Age is the most significant predictor of heart disease severity.  
- Cholesterol and blood pressure are also significant but have smaller effects.  
- Early detection using these factors can help identify high-risk individuals for timely intervention.
